## Development environment
To open our application, on Spring Tool Suite, you have to: 
Press File ->Import -> Existing Maven Projects -> Browse..(And select the folder where the project is placed).
Then press Finish, and the project is already imported.

To prepare the database with mysql. Open mysql workbench, create a new connection with the propierties:
Name: Local Instance MySQL 57, Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP), Hostname: localhost, Port:3306, username:root, and password:pass.
Then press close, and run the connection.
In the connection, create a new schema, with the name: Test.

After that, come back to the STS, and in the project that u have imported, go to the folder tradium, and run the application, as a 
Spring boot app. 

And that's all!
